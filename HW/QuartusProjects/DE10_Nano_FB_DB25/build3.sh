# This script builds various PIN configurations targeting this board
# Usage:
#     ./build.sh [config [config]]
#
# If you want to build a particular configuration, specify it on the
# command line, otherwise the default is to build all configurations
#
# This is a batch file because each configuration needs to be built
# sequentially for two reasons:
#
#   1} The hostmot_cfg.vhd file needs to be customized for each config
#
#   2} You cannot run multiple Quartus builds in the same directory
#      simultaniously or BadThings happen
#
# Should the build process ever migrate to running each Quartus build
# in it's own Docker container, each of those containers could have
# their own local build directory and run simultaniously.

# Some specifics for this build, adjust as necessary
